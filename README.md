# resume-analysis

Resume analysis is a critical stage in the recruitment and candidate selection process. Traditionally handled by recruiters and HR professionals, it involves hours of examining documents to identify suitable candidates. This process, while thorough, is time-consuming and susceptible to human errors and biases, potentially resulting in the misselection or loss of qualified talent.

Resume assessment entails meticulously reading each document, comparing qualifications, skills, and experiences with job requirements, and organizing information to facilitate decision-making. Despite its effectiveness in some aspects, this method is inefficient time-wise, especially when dealing with a large volume of resumes.
With technological advancements, Artificial Intelligence (AI) emerges as a powerful tool to revolutionize and optimize resume analysis and selection. AI can automate many repetitive and time-consuming tasks involved in resume reviewing, allowing recruiters to focus on more strategic aspects of the selection process.
Our proposal is to use AI to extract personal information, professional experiences, education from PDF files, perform aptitude classification for a position, and provide a justification for that.

In this work, we will use the Langchain library in conjunction with OpenAI's GPT-4o model. LangChain is a platform that integrates natural language processing technology for text analysis and information extraction.
